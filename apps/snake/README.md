# snake game

This is a fast paced discrete game. Think snake from nokia but using ascii art and multiple snakes.  
It shows how to use the `Board.sync/patch()` feature one can find in [compete-utils](../../packages/compete-utils/).  
Obstacles appear every couple of ticks and food as well. Movement and eating increase the snake size.  
The visuals are rendered in HTML text for simplicity.

Game should be fully playable. Every time a player enters or leaves the round restarts.
