# go fish game

This is a slow paced multiplayer card game.  
It shows how to use the `trackObject` feature one can find in [compete-utils](../../packages/compete-utils/).  
The visuals are done with pixijs and a great SVG card deck.

This game is meant to be played with the mouse and it's development is not yet complete!
Round starts only once 2 players have joined.
