## play

each turn (passes to the left)
player chooses a rank and a destination opponent to ask for that rank, saying it out loud (ex: asking for kings).
the person asking must have at least 1 card of the rank being asked. (he's fishing)
the addressed player must hand all card of that rank he owns, if any.
if he has none, he says "go fish!" and the asker picks the top card from the stock pile and adds it to his hand.
it the picked card is the asked card, he reveals it and he's entitled to ask something else in this turn (may be another rank and to another player).
When the player has a book in his hand he should reserve it facing up on a table and keep playing.
When a catch is not successful the turn passes to the player to the left.

if someone's hand becomes empty, he's entitled to take a card from the pile and play, if one exists. otherwise the player is out of the game.

the player with the most books at the end of the game wins.
